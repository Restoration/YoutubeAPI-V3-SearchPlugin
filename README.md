> ### Before you start
> You need a Google Account to access the Google Developers Console, request an API key, and register your application.
>
> Create a project in the Google Developers Console and obtain authorization credentials so your application can submit API requests.
> After creating your project, make sure the YouTube Data API is one of the services that your application is registered to use:
> Go to the Developers Console and select the project that you just registered.
> Open the API Library in the Google Developers Console. If prompted, select a project or create a new one. In the list of APIs, make sure the 
status is ON for the YouTube Data API v3.
> If your application will use any API methods that require user authorization, read the authentication guide to learn how to implement OAuth 2.0 
authorization.
> Select a client library to simplify your API implementation.
> Familiarize yourself with the core concepts of the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data format. JSON is a common, language-independent data 
format that provides a simple text representation of arbitrary data structures. For more information, see json.org.
